    "\n",
    "1. What is a SQL?\n",
    "    - R.: SQL is a Standardize Language for interacting with R.D.B.M.S. (Relational Databases Management System).\n",
    "    - Used to perform C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as well as other administrative taks (user management, security, backup, etc).\n",
    "    - Used to define tables and schemas structures.\n",
    "    - SQL code used on one R.D.B.M.S is not always portable to another without modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a database?\n",
    "    - Any collection of related information. There are two types of Databases,\n",
    "        **relational databases** and **non-relational databases**. there are special that helps users create and maintain a databases called **Databases Management System** (D.B.M.S). DBMS allows you to perform the C.R.U.D. operations and other administrative tasks.\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. What are relational databases?\n",
    "    - Organize data into one or more tables.\n",
    "    - Each table has columns and rows.\n",
    "    - A unique Key identifies each row.\n",
    "4. What is a query?\n",
    "    - A query is a set of instructions given to the R.D.B.M.S. (write in SQL) that tell the R.D.B.M.S. what information you want it to retrive for you, **the goal is to only get the data you need**.\n",
    "    - Queries are requests made to the database management system for specific information.\n",
    "    - As the database structure becomes more complex, getting the specific information we want becomes more difficcult.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. What are the **Primary Key** and **Foreing Key**?\n",
    "    - **Primary Key**: an unique attribute defines the row in the database.\n",
    "    - **Foreign Key** an attribute that we can store on a database table that will link us to another database, it's another **Primary Key** inside anoter table.\n",
    "    - **Composite Key**: Key that needs two attibutes.\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "1. SQL commands\n",
    "    - DDL: Data Definition Language, used for defining database schemas, for instance, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE,...\n",
    "    - DML: Data Manipulation Language, used for inserting, updating, and deleting data from databases (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, ...).\n",
    "    - DCL: Data Control Language, used for controlling access to the data in the databases, and user and permissions management (GRANT, REVOKE, ...).\n",
    "    - CTL: Control Transaction Language (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, ...).\n",
    "    - DQL: Data Query Languege, used to query the data for information and get information that is already there (SELECT, ...).\n",
    "    - Parent child ralationship: a parent-child relationship between two tables can be created only when there is a **PRIMARY KEY**  in one table and **FOREIGN KEY** in another table. (w33resource)\n",
    "    - Child table: a child table inherits the **PRIMARY KEY** colums of its parent table. (oracle)\n",
    "    - Parent table: the table with the **FOREING KEY** is called the child table, and the table with the **PRIMARY KEY** is called the referenced or parent table.(w3schools)"
